# rust_level_editor

A renderer demo, uses macroquad to render the window/canvas and get the input. 
The renderer works without macroquad and generates a pixel buffer(which will be streched) for the canvas to render.

You can test the live demo at [https://anilder89.github.io/rust_level_editor/](https://anilder89.github.io/rust_level_editor/).
Use left mouse button to place nodes or to select nodes. If you select two nodes, the editor will connect them. You can remove node with right click.
